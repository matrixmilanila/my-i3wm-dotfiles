For this config you need:
-+ feh
-+ picom
-+ i3status
its a simple rice i made, that im gonna update frequently once i discover more better things about it
the wallpaper is located here: https://gruvbox-wallpapers.pages.dev/wallpapers/anime/5m5kLI9.png
to replace your current i3wm config and picom config you need to:
-; After you download the dotfiles, first you gotta create a backup of your current i3wm config, same as your picom config
-; Then copy and paste the i3 config file to the config folder that should be in ~/.config/i3
-; if it asks you if you want to replace the files, say yes, once your done doing that part, dont restart i3 yet
-; now, we gotta do the same for picom, picom config file is in ~/.config.
and thats all you gotta do to get my config!!































































































































THIS IS THE ORIGINAL VERSION INCASE YOU FIND A FAKE ONE. I POSTED THIS CONFIG AT R/UNIXPORN. (Unless the post has been deleted)/ MY REDDIT IS U/AKANEZZX
